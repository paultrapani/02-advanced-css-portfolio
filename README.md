## Description ðŸ“„
The purpose of this repo project is to create a portfolio website to showcase my work, skills, and talents so that employers who might be looking to hire for positions can assess if I'm a good fit or not.  This site will be an ongoing work in progress as I learn more skills, develop and design more things, I will continue to add to it and enhance it.
