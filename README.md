## Description 📄| ℹ️

The purpose of this repo project is to create a portfolio website to showcase my work, skills, and talents so that employers who might be looking to hire for positions can assess if I'm a good fit or not.  This site will be an ongoing work in progress as I learn more skills, develop and design more things, I will continue to add to it and enhance it.

## Notes 📄|🚧

I'm still making design tweaks to some areas of content in the page as well as working to pull together actual samples of work to then incorporate into the "Work" section of the page.  

My Resume is a rough draft which you can get to by clicking on the "Resume" link in the top site navigation menu.

I'm still working on image overlays and animation using CSS for my "portfolio work samples" (flex-box items) in the "Work" section.
